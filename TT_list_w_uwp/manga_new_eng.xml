		<gioi_thieu>Takeru and Meo, two best friends both troubled by tragedies in their pasts, have been sweeping local junior karate tournaments as high school freshmen. But now, they set their sights on a national karate tournament. Unfortunately, the funding required to achieve their goal can only be secured if they form an official karate club at their school. Their first challenge lies in getting past the beautiful student council president Izumi Touko, who also happens to be the only daughter of the head of the biggest karate organization in the world, Koudan-kai (which is totally not Kyokushin). What plot will Touko hatch, and what price is she going to exact from them? As Takeru and Meo embark on their official karate journey which will lead them to confront their pasts, almost the entire cast of Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru makes an appearance, guiding them, and teaching them the true meaning of what it is to be a karate-ka.</gioi_thieu>

		<gioi_thieu>Gabimaru the Empty, a former ninja assassin known feared as a heartless husk of a man, spends his days on death row wondering when an executioner skilled enough to so much as harm him will arrive, as he thinks nothing of seeing an end to his meaningless existence... Or so he thought. Then the lady executioner, Asaemon the Beheader, rekindles his hope with an astounding proposition. If he ever wishes to see his beloved wife again, he is, under the auspices of the shogunate, to embark on a perilous voyage to the mysterious mystic island said to house the elixir of immortality. Should he be the one among many rival death-row fiends and scoundrels to find the elixir, he'll earn a full exoneration, and, more importantly, a chance at an ordinary married life with the light of his life--the woman who made the world seem not so ugly. What awaits them is a journey like no other!</gioi_thieu>

Long hours helping his mother run their family business, a fishing boat store, has left him without the time to make friends and so he remains an introverted loner, doomed to be beaten day in and day out.

Hana, the orphaned daughter of Korean peasants, and Kenichi, son of a great samurai leader, have little in common except for a mutual disdain for the other. But these young warriors will have to work together when an army invades the island with shocking news: there is a new Shogun and the Island is expected to pay fealty in exchange for protection from a new enemy...a mutated horde that threatens to wipe out all humanity.

        <gioi_thieu>CHRISTOPHER HASTINGS (The Unbelievable Gwenpool! Secret Agent Deadpool! Adventure Time! I Am Groot!) and DAVID HAHN (Batman '66! Bombshells: United!) proudly present a story from a time when there wasn't internet, but there WERE cyborgs! It's the 1970s. Things are going great. Steve Austen (used to be an astronaut, now has robo-parts and a laser eye) heads to Japan to help Secret Agent Niko Abe stop a madman with missiles. Steve figures, no sweat. But then...sweat. How's Steve going to complete his mission, when his fancy $6,000,000 body starts. DRASTICALLY) depreciating in value!?</gioi_thieu>

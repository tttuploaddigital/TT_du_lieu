Two years later, the clock tower is known as the 'ghost tower' and it is supposedly haunted. Through an unusual series of events, a young NEET man named Amano Taichi is attacked by someone or something in the same clock tower, and finds himself bound to the clock face to be killed in the same way as the old woman. Luckily for Amano, he doesn't meet the same fate. He's rescued by a mysterious person who claims his name is Tetsuo. Tetsuo is searching for a treasure that is connected with the ghost tower, and he wants Taichi to be his partner. Taichi, whose life has mostly consisted of poverty, loneliness, and pornography, is enticed by the idea of gaining extreme wealth. He's further convinced when a house fire leaves him without a home and depends on Tetsuo's charity. The adventure is going to be very dangerous, since the same 'enemies' who attacked Taichi before seem certain to try something again! Not to mention, Taichi really knows very little about his new partner.</gioi_thieu>

		<gioi_thieu>Yuuki Tsumire was raised by her single mother, who always told her to keep smiling, no matter what hardships she endured. The two of them were a family, until Tsumire's mother died from illness. Tsumire soon learned that she had a family she knew nothing about: a cold, rich family that disowned her kindhearted mother when she became pregnant. Tsumire now must go live with this family, even though none of them seem to want her there. She doesn't have to switch schools, so she at least has her friends to help her through this difficult time. However, she doesn't have the heart to confide in her friends with even more problems, so she tries to keep it bottled up inside. To her surprise, the Yuuki family lawyer, a young man named Hino, soon becomes her emotional support in this difficult situation. However, Tsumire's reactions to him might mean that she wishes he were something more... Thanks go to tethysdust for the summary.</gioi_thieu>

		<gioi_thieu>Here starts the Konya spinoff series, focusing more on Gorou and Verde! There's plenty of Endou and Rikiya as well, but this story will spend more time telling the story of these heretofore side characters. The story takes place immediately after the last Konya chapter, so you can think of this as Chapter 20, just less focus on Endo/Rikiya and more on Gorou/Verde.</gioi_thieu>

		<gioi_thieu>The background is in the distant future, a post-apocalyptic world after the destruction brought about by Armageddon. The war between humans (Terran) and vampires (Methuselah) continues, as a struggle between two factions: the Vatican and the New Human Empire. Yet, amidst the bloodshed and violence, many desire a peaceful co-existence between the two species. However, standing between them and this goal is the Rosenkreuz Orden, a group of vampire extremists who manipulate the two sides and pit them against each other. To combat them, the Vatican special operations group 'AX,' led by Cardinal Caterina, must use everything they have - even a vampire who preys on the blood of other vampires.</gioi_thieu>

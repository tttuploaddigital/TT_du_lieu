		<gioi_thieu>Sotomura is a high-school girl widely regarded as a delinquent, feared and avoided by many of the school body. From her light-brown hair down to her long skirt and harsh manner of speaking, she completely seems the part. But after Sotomura rescues a girl named Haruno from some bullies, Haruno decides to try to get to know her better. Haruno is surprised to find out that Sotomura isn't a delinquent at all and is, in fact, just a very socially awkward girl that's bad with words and wants to make friends. She enjoys cooking, handicrafts, and hitting the supermarket sales. She also loves cute and fancy things, but she tries to hide that fact because she feels they don't suit her looks. Haruno's first step in helping Sotomura is to try to teach her how to smile, because whenever she tries, it ends up as a scary grin. Thus begins the story of Sotomura's attempts to make new friends.</gioi_thieu>

The high-school-age older sister, Kyoko, is pretty wild (and is even into pro-wrestling), while the elementary-school-age little brother is a fairly serious kid.

        <gioi_thieu>Not just another retelling of the Macross saga... the story continues as we bring Carl Macek's original vision full circle. Taking into account every iteration of the series, this new Robotech casts a fresh eye over classic characters like Rick Hunter, Lisa Hayes, Lynn Minmei, Roy Fokker, Claudia Grant, and Henry Gloval. Brian Wood and Marco Turini take us back to a Macross Island where 'nothing' can be taken for granted.</gioi_thieu>

        <gioi_thieu>Sometimes...you embrace your destiny. And sometimes... you and your trouble-making adopted brother find yourselves trapped in a scientific lab explosion that grants you ****ing awesome super-powers. As a result of their accident, Eric and Woody Henderson - aka Quantum and Woody - must 'klang' their wristbands together every 24 hours or both dissipate into nothingness. Which makes superhero-ing pretty awkward when you're not on speaking terms at the moment. See, Eric has been keeping a pretty big secret: He knows who Woody's birth father really is...and where he's been hiding all these years. With great power comes great sibling rivalry! This winter, you'll believe two men and one goat can split a one-bedroom apartment and still be a credible threat to evil and injustice everywhere when QUANTUM AND WOODY make headlines and take names!</gioi_thieu>

All he's ever known is killing and the kindness of his master, Chen, the closest thing Sang has to a father. When Sang's enthusiasm botches a job, it brings the wrath of Don Minchella down on the pair, resulting in Chen's murder. Barely escaping with his own life -- and with Minchella's severed arm in tow -- Sang swears revenge, while every gang in the city mobilizes to return him to Minchella, dead or alive.</gioi_thieu>

        <gioi_thieu>Simon Spurrier (The Spire, Godshaper) and Matias Bergara (Cannibal, Supergirl) present a broken fantasy world that's perfect for fans of Mad Max and The Lord of the Rings. In the aftermath of an apocalypse which wiped out nearly all magic from a once-wondrous fantasy world, a former bard named Hum (a man of few words, so nicknamed because his standard reply is 'hm') seeks a way to save the soul of his wife with nothing but a foul-tempered mutant unicorn and his wits to protect him... but is unwillingly drawn into a brutal power struggle which will decide forever who rules the Weird Wasteland.</gioi_thieu>

        <gioi_thieu>For thirty years, the demon of vengeance has been still, its corpse buried in a pumpkin patch graveyard in the hills. But when a reckless driver accidentally kills a pair of children, the creature is called up once more. This time, though, the monster's intended target is protected by a cruel backwoods crime family. They hatch their own supernatural plans for dealing with Pumpkinhead. For each of man's sins, a special demon exists, and when seven infernal creatures roam the hills and the hollows, no one-guilty or otherwise-is safe.</gioi_thieu>

        <gioi_thieu>After a black writer is found dead at a scandalous interracial party in 1920s New York, Harlem's cub reporter Zane Pinchback is the only one determined to solve the murder. Zane must go 'incognegro' for the first time--using his light appearance to pass as a white man--to find the true killer, in this prequel miniseries to the critically acclaimed Vertigo graphic novel, now available in a special new 10th Anniversary Edition. With a cryptic manuscript as his only clue, and a mysterious and beautiful woman as the murder's only witness, Zane finds himself on the hunt through the dark and dangerous streets of 'roaring twenties' Harlem in search for justice. A page-turning thriller of racial divide, Incognegro: Renaissance explores segregation, secrets, and self-image as our race-bending protagonist penetrates a world where he feels stranger than ever before.</gioi_thieu>

        <gioi_thieu>For a while now, the original Ghostbusters have had access to an interdimensional portal that has given them all-new ways to research the paranormal and consult with Ghostbusters throughout the multiverse... but they haven't shared this tech with any of those other Ghostbusters, and some don't think that's fair. That's why, after a chance meeting, Jillian Holtzmann and Ron Alexander have decided to right this wrong and cobble together their own working portal... which unintentionally unleashes the contents of the Ghostbusters' Containment Unit! That's a lot of ghosts, and it's going to take a lot of Ghostbusters to recapture them. In fact, it's going to take ALL of them. Crossing Over starts here!</gioi_thieu>

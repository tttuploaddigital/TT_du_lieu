        <gioi_thieu>Sometimes...you embrace your destiny. And sometimes... you and your trouble-making adopted brother find yourselves trapped in a scientific lab explosion that grants you ****ing awesome super-powers. As a result of their accident, Eric and Woody Henderson - aka Quantum and Woody - must 'klang' their wristbands together every 24 hours or both dissipate into nothingness. Which makes superhero-ing pretty awkward when you're not on speaking terms at the moment. See, Eric has been keeping a pretty big secret: He knows who Woody's birth father really is...and where he's been hiding all these years. With great power comes great sibling rivalry! This winter, you'll believe two men and one goat can split a one-bedroom apartment and still be a credible threat to evil and injustice everywhere when QUANTUM AND WOODY make headlines and take names!</gioi_thieu>

        <gioi_thieu>Kidnapped off the streets of the Philippines as an infant and trained as a child assassin, Sang has never had a childhood. All he's ever known is killing and the kindness of his master, Chen, the closest thing Sang has to a father. When Sang's enthusiasm botches a job, it brings the wrath of Don Minchella down on the pair, resulting in Chen's murder. Barely escaping with his own life -- and with Minchella's severed arm in tow -- Sang swears revenge, while every gang in the city mobilizes to return him to Minchella, dead or alive.</gioi_thieu>

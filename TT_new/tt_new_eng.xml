		<gioi_thieu>Three Years ago a Hero sealed a Hell Gate. The Seal has been weakening ever since, sporadically letting Monsters through. After a big Group of Monsters entered the Country through a Hell Gate, the profession of Heroes was needed again. Touka Scott a small Radish Farmer in the southern Town of Cheza is prepared for sudden Monster Attacks. He built himself a hidden Pittrap with Bamboo spikes, to lure unsuspecting Monsters in if they ever try to Attack the Village. Suddenly a Monster attacks. Touka tries to lure it into the Trap with freshly roasted Bacon, but the Monster dislikes this type of Meat. Thankfully the local Hero saves the Village from the Monster in the nick of Time. The hungry Hero tries to grab a bite of Bacon after vanquishing the Monster, only to stumble into Toukas Pittrap and Die. After causing the local Heros Death, Touka is forced to take matters into his own Hands to protect the Region from attacking Monsters.</gioi_thieu>

It features three friends, all women aged 29, who get together and socialize regularly and indulge in their common passion: drinking. Michiko Takase, the office lady heroine, prefers beer; Misono Miyauchi, a short-haired, muscular book store worker, likes sake; and Yuki Shinonome, the feminine housewife, drinks everything. The manga follows them as they visit hot springs, beer gardens, bars and more to sample different drinks, pair them with delicious side dishes, and chat about work, their family, how to keep warm while wearing skirts, etc.</gioi_thieu>

The principal told her to do this, after she flunked every subject and makeup-class they put her in. He gets her to successfully finish a batch of cookies after several mishaps and is touched by his students glee over her success.

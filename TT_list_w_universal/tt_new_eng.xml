        <gioi_thieu>Bucky Barnes believes in second chances. Having escaped death, the loss of identity, and a life of murder, the man known as the Winter Soldier has worked hard to atone for his sins. But now...he's going to go one step further. What do you do when you've found redemption? You help others do the same. From KYLE HIGGINS (Nightwing, Power Rangers, C.O.W.L.) and ROD REIS (SECRET EMPIRE, DOCTOR STRANGE: DAMNATION, C.O.W.L.) comes the next chapter in the saga of the Winter Soldier. He's becoming a 'fixer,' working to help others leave behind lives of crime. It's Bucky's way of channeling his own pain in a productive, personal way...by helping others find the redemption that he found. However, as Bucky is going to learn, not all paths are the same... and not everyone can be 'saved.'</gioi_thieu>

Home to the Transformers, and a thriving hub for inter-stellar commerce, it is a world brimming with organic and constructed diversity. Immense structures line its landscape.

		<gioi_thieu>Smile at the Runway starts with the story of Fujito Chiyuki, an aspiring fashion model and daughter of a fledgling Modeling Agency, Mille neige. Ever since she was little, Chiyuki's dream was to be the star model of her dad's agency and perform at Paris Fashion Week. With great looks and a gifted environment, it seemed like she was on the right track to fulfill her dream, but she soon found herself faced with a seemingly insurmountable wall when her height stopped growing at 158cm (5'2''), hopelessly too short to be a professional model. Although Chiyuki still kept on believing in herself for years despite everyone telling her it's impossible, Chiyuki's resolve starts to crumble as she enters her last year of high school. This is when she meets Tsumura Ikuto, a lame classmate with a surprising talent for designing clothes, who is also considering giving up his dream due to unfortunate circumstances. Together, they begin the journey of doing the impossible in order to realize their dreams.</gioi_thieu>

		<gioi_thieu>In the 13th century, the Mongolian Empire rapidly expands across the globe. Later historians who studied the prophecies of Nostradamus would say that Mongolia was the birthplace of the 'Great King of Terror,' Angolmois. And at last, the force of the Mongolian Empire would turn their attention toward Japan... 1274: The Bun'ei Invasion. The exiled samurai Jinzaburo Kuchii is in Kamakura when he finds himself face to face with this invasion. This story is a fresh look at the great battle that rocked all of medieval Japan: the Mongol Invasion. It shows how the people of Tsushima panicked, struggled, and eventually rose up against the overwhelming forces of their enemy.</gioi_thieu>

		<gioi_thieu>Takeru and Meo, two best friends both troubled by tragedies in their pasts, have been sweeping local junior karate tournaments as high school freshmen. But now, they set their sights on a national karate tournament. Unfortunately, the funding required to achieve their goal can only be secured if they form an official karate club at their school. Their first challenge lies in getting past the beautiful student council president Izumi Touko, who also happens to be the only daughter of the head of the biggest karate organization in the world, Koudan-kai (which is totally not Kyokushin). What plot will Touko hatch, and what price is she going to exact from them? As Takeru and Meo embark on their official karate journey which will lead them to confront their pasts, almost the entire cast of Karate Shoukoushi Kohinata Minoru makes an appearance, guiding them, and teaching them the true meaning of what it is to be a karate-ka.</gioi_thieu>

		<gioi_thieu>Welcome to Nanba, the world's largest, most impenetrable prison. Locked away in cell block 13 are four inmates - Juugo, Uno, Rock, and Nico - who provide more than enough trouble for prison guard Sugoroku Hajime to deal with. Between attempted breakouts, gambling and general misbehaviour, these four believe that just because they're in prison doesn't mean they can't have fun. But it isn't all a barrel of laughs, because our protagonist Juugo is hiding a dark past which may soon come to destroy their idyllic prison life...</gioi_thieu>

		<gioi_thieu>Gabimaru the Empty, a former ninja assassin known feared as a heartless husk of a man, spends his days on death row wondering when an executioner skilled enough to so much as harm him will arrive, as he thinks nothing of seeing an end to his meaningless existence... Or so he thought. Then the lady executioner, Asaemon the Beheader, rekindles his hope with an astounding proposition. If he ever wishes to see his beloved wife again, he is, under the auspices of the shogunate, to embark on a perilous voyage to the mysterious mystic island said to house the elixir of immortality. Should he be the one among many rival death-row fiends and scoundrels to find the elixir, he'll earn a full exoneration, and, more importantly, a chance at an ordinary married life with the light of his life--the woman who made the world seem not so ugly. What awaits them is a journey like no other!</gioi_thieu>

Long hours helping his mother run their family business, a fishing boat store, has left him without the time to make friends and so he remains an introverted loner, doomed to be beaten day in and day out. Although he hates being bullied, he hates himself even more for not being able to fight back against his tormentors. 'What is it like to be strong?' he asks himself as he stares at his clenched fist.

At the Kamogawa Gym, Ippo now trains with the aspirations of becoming a professional boxer and discovering what it means to be strong.</gioi_thieu>
